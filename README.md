# Introduction

Welcome to the amazing world of Pixelmon. I made this pack with a desire to have the ultimate crossover. I really enjoy the source material but I hate having 19 games to play when I wish to catch them all. Thanks to the power of coding now we can on a voxel engine. Also simply catching monsters can get kind of boring, I figured fill the game with life ya know? Building is the real press for this pack and I think once you see everything you got to work with you will most likely feel that way too.

# FAQ

* Little Tiles - When using "Little Tiles" disable the "JEI" overlay or the preview will not work. I know there are lighting issues in the preview render but I am unsure how to solve them right now. Do not try to use the "Slice" option because it is very buggy. Check this link out for more details on how to use this mod. " https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki "

# Authors Notes

I apologize but I need to redo this project. I have learned more ways I can make my project a great deal more awesome with significantly less performance hits. One of the most important things I have come to the conclusion of is I need to always fill out the data entry and changelog. If I remember to always do this and include information on what the pack tends to offer I will have an idea of what features could actually be missing. Please report broken recipes.
