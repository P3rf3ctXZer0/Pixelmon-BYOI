# Introduction

Welcome to the amazing world of Pixelmon. I made this pack with a desire to have the ultimate crossover. I really enjoy the source material but I hate having 19 games to play when I wish to catch them all. Thanks to the power of coding now we can on a voxel engine. Also simply catching monsters can get kind of boring, I figured fill the game with life ya know? Building is the real press for this pack and I think once you see everything you got to work with you will most likely feel that way too.

# FAQ

* Alternative Links - Due to the many bugs with "Curse launcher (twitch launcher for now)" and the fact that my user base has preference I will also be hosting "technic launcher" versions and "MultiMC" versions. As a more permanent solution.

* Better Records - In order to etch a record you first have to make it a "Direct" dropbox link. Do this by converting it with this tool. http://www.isgoodstuff.com/dropbox/

* Building Gadgets - The ultimate building tool. (Does not copy fluid.) (Does not destroy land claimed areas or overwrite existing blocks.)

* Little Tiles - When using "Little Tiles" disable the "JEI" overlay or the preview will not work. I know there are lighting issues in the preview render but I am unsure how to solve them right now. Do not try to use the "Slice" option because it is very buggy. Check this link out for more details on how to use this mod. " https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki "

* Pixelmon - If at any point your playing and your battle refuses to end simply do "/endbattle" as a command.

* Server Information - Twitch seems to randomly fail at uploading my server.dat so here is the exact information.

Pixelmon Evolved
73.185.156.214:25550

* Structurize - It seems glitchy and half complete but functional. I recommend using "Building Gadgets Copy Paste Tool" to copy structures but if you build a "Minecolony" you should be able to use this item to make custom structures. Make sure that you have a working left and right mouse button because they didn't allow for custom hotkeys and you will see first hand it's a bit glitchy. 

* Twitch Issues - Twitch Launcher is for some reason exporting my pack with forestry even though it is not intended to be in my pack. Also some users have reported server information issues. If you suddenly get forestry or any mod not listed please delete it. Not doing so will make the pack crash or have other issues I cannot predict.

# Features 

* Build-centric - If you build it they will come. Legit a ton of ways to do basically anything. At this point we are one of the de facto building packs by the sheer level of options available.

* Defenses - With the edition of  Electric Fences, Turrets and more you can make a truly amazing fortress.

* Exploration - There is so much to explore! I have added all available stable dimensions mods that allow for so much exploration.

* Gear-centric - There is an insane amount of gear. Borderlands got nothing on us :D 

* Land claim - We have land claim thanks to "FTBUtilities" I disabled the land claim for "Minecolonies" because the version we are using causes things to break with it activated.


* Online Multiplayer - The complete experience.

* Pocket Monsters - You can battle legit monsters which chill in your pocket when not in battle.

* PVP Ready - With land claim courtesy of "FTBUtilities" and defenses courtesy of "Open Modular Turrets" and "Security Craft" you can truly pvp.

* Questing - Coming to a modpack near you (some day) - "Not sure how to best implement it."

* Survival-centric - Leaderboards, Spice of Life and more encourage survival. You will feel infinite pain if you lose your gear.

* Tech-centric - Build amazing little machines using "Ender IO, Mekanism and Botania."
