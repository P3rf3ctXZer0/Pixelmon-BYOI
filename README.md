# Introduction

Welcome to the amazing world of Pixelmon. I made this pack with a desire to have the ultimate crossover. I really enjoy the source material but I hate having 19 games to play when I wish to catch them all. Thanks to the power of coding now we can on a voxel engine. Also simply catching monsters can get kind of boring.

# Modlist

# -J-

* JourneyMap - A minimap mod with waypoints, fullscreen map and death beacons.

* JustEnoughIDs - A mod which removes all ID limits from 1.12.2 similar to the 1.13+ update.

* Just Enough Items - A very polished and efficient recipe browser.

# -P-

* Pixelmon - A huge mod which adds lots of Pocket Monsters to the game with many forms and is turn based when engaged with other mons.
