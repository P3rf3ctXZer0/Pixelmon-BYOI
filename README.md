# Introduction

Welcome to the amazing world of Pixelmon. I made this pack with a desire to have the ultimate crossover. I really enjoy the source material but I hate having 19 games to play when I wish to catch them all. Thanks to the power of coding now we can on a voxel engine. Also simply catching monsters can get kind of boring, I figured fill the game with life ya know? Building is the real press for this pack and I think once you see everything you got to work with you will most likely feel that way too.

# FAQ

* Alternative Links - Due to the many bugs with "Curse launcher (twitch launcher for now)" and the fact that my user base has preference I will also be hosting "technic launcher" versions and "MultiMC" versions. As a more permanent solution.

* Little Tiles - When using "Little Tiles" disable the "JEI" overlay or the preview will not work. I know there are lighting issues in the preview render but I am unsure how to solve them right now. Do not try to use the "Slice" option because it is very buggy. Check this link out for more details on how to use this mod. " https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki "

* Pixelmon - If at any point your playing and your battle refuses to end simply do "/endbattle" as a command.

* Server Information - Twitch seems to randomly fail at uploading my server.dat so here is the exact information.

Pixelmon Evolved
73.185.156.214:25550

* Twitch Issues - Twitch Launcher is for some reason exporting my pack with forestry even though it is not intended to be in my pack. Also some users have reported server information issues. If you suddenly get forestry or any mod not listed please delete it. Not doing so will make the pack crash or have other issues I cannot predict.
