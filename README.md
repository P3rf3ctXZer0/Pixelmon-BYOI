# Features

* No Server Spawn - I am not making nor have a desire to make a spawn. I made a box. Its good enough.

* Adventuring - There is so much to see including huge changes to the Nether and End. The Abyssal allows the player to go somewhere spo0ky. The between lands allow for new kinds of exploration. (Not a typo) 

* Automation - There are many ways of automatic crafting, farming, resource gathering and even construction. Thanks to EnderIO, Mystical Agriculture, and Refined Storage.  

* Building - This mod pack features many ways to build thanks to the mods Architect, ArchitectureCraft, Building Gadgets, Chisel, Chisel Unlimited, Chisel and Bits, Extra Bit Manipulation, Flat Colored Blocks, Little Frames, Little Tiles and Schematics. Anything you can think of and have the resources to make is possible. Save buildings and crafts and even export them. 

* Ever Scaling - Everything in the world scales. Enemies, Health, Hunger, Survival I would add TAN, but I do have a heart :D

* Get Good - Enemies can spawn as blights and champions. You need good gear and scale your health and level your tools. No explosions. Get insulted on death.

* Land Claim and QoL - Huds options and landclaims.

* Pixelmon-Hybrid - This is a Pixelmon server but not like you are used to. Pixelmon is here but unlike most servers it is not the sole source of gameplay.

* Survival - This is a survival server. If you die your loot gets placed in a gravestone. Eating the same thing punishes you. Enemies scale. Good luck.

* Technical - If you like multi block machines and different ways to make things with pipes and more we got you covered. I am not very good at this stuff, but I know it works.

* Unprofessional - Not here to help or waste my time teaching you how to play. If you get on the server, and you skip steps good luck. I will answer some things as long as I have not written it down in the "How to Play" Manual.

* We are now proudly supported by "Bisect Hosting" If you are looking for a stable and easy to understand server host with prompt and effective support for all your server related problems. Please consider giving them a try as I have been using them off and on since 2017 and I have to say compared to the competitors; they are bar none one of the best hosts out there. Lag-less and dedicated to performance their servers are fast and reliable. 

* Use promo code **"Zer0G"** for 25% off the service fee for the first month. I recommend most people use a "4GB" package but you can also buy more or less if you need it. Also, it helps support this and other future projects I release. ~ xWingedTenacityx#7693
